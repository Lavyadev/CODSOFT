# MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the genre of a movie based on its description. The model is trained on a dataset of movie descriptions and their respective genres, and evaluated using test data with known genre labels.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to classify movies into different genres based on textual descriptions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification.
