## Introduction
<br/>
SMS spam detection is a common problem in natural language processing. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or legitimate (ham). We will use techniques like TF-IDF for feature extraction and classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build the model.

## Dataset
<br/>
The dataset used in this project is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset. It contains 5,574 SMS messages, each labeled as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam". You can download the dataset from [here](#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).
